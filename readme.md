## Technical Overview

This section provides an insight into the architecture of the project, focusing on the models, controllers, routes, and views used in the application.

### Models

The application utilizes **Mongoose** to define the data structure and interactions with MongoDB. Apartment model represents a collection in the database:

#### Apartment Data Structure Example

Below is an example of how the apartment data will appear once it's stored in MongoDB:

```json
